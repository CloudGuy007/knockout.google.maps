knockout.google.maps
====================

Knockout bindings for Google Maps, to make view models completely independent from presentation.

Supported features (up to now)
==============================

* Map (obviously)
* Marker (of course)
* InfoWindow
* DirectionsRenderer (partially)

And as extensions:

* [MarkerClusterer](https://github.com/manuel-guilbault/knockout.google.maps.clusterer)
* [InfoBox](https://github.com/manuel-guilbault/knockout.google.maps.infobox)

This project is still in progress, so not all properties are supported right now, and more features are coming (ex: DirectionsRenderer, map controls, street view). Contributors are welcome, so if you're interested in giving a hand, just [let me know](mailto:manuel.guilbault@gmail.com).
